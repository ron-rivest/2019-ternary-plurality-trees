    "#### Abstract\n",
    "\n",
    "We suggest using \"_ternary plurality trees_\" to define a voting method (called TPT). \n",
    "TPT voting is quite close to, but different than, plurality voting; we examine how close TPT and plurality are.\n",
    "\n",
    "Perhaps the most interesting aspects of TPT voting have to do with auditing.  Auditing a TPT contest is __combinatorial__ in character rather than __statistical__ (as with a risk-limiting audit).  With TPT voting an election contest with $3^d$ cast ballots can be audited in a _zero-risk_ manner by manually examining only $2^d$ cast paper ballots, in the case of two candidates, with no missing or invalid ballots.  For example, a two-candidate contest with one million cast paper ballots may be audited by examining only 6104 ballots, assuming no interpretation errors are found in the audit.\n",
    "\n",
    "The $n$ cast ballots are arranged as the leaves in a ternary tree of height $\\log_3(n)$.\n",
    "Each internal node of the tree has a value equal to the plurality vote of its three children (with ties broken pseudorandomly).\n",
    "The value at the root is the winner of the contest, by definition.\n",
    "Auditing the contest outcome requires examining only two of every three children of audited nodes (assuming two candidates and no discrepancies discovered).\n",
    "\n",
    "The TPT voting method is quite close to, but different than, plurality voting; we \n",
    "examine how close TPT and plurality are.\n",
    "\n",
    "The outcome of a TPT election may depend on the way in which ballots are assigned to\n",
    "leaves of the tree.  TPT assigns ballots to leaves in a randomized manner to ensure \n",
    "that all voters may expect an equal voice in the outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "We present the result of a simple experiment illustrating how auditing a TPT election expands gracefully when interpretation errors are found.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we show how the TPT method extends to handle multiple candidates\n",
    "and ballots with missing or invalid choices.\n"

    "** Motivating example **\n",
    "\n",
    "We begin with a quick example that illustrates many of the key ideas.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine that we have an election with nine voters, each voting for one of two candidates, A or B. The first voter votes for B, the second for A, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "We arrange the nine votes as the leaves of a ternary tree of depth two, shown as labelled square boxes in the figure below.  The voter's number is shown below each leaf.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are four internal nodes, drawn as circles: the root at the top at level 0, and three internal nodes at level 1 which are its children.  Each level-1 node has three leaves as its children.\n",
    "\n",
    "The winner of the contest is computed on this tree in a bottom-up manner.  Each leaf has a value that is the that voter's choice.  Each internal node has a value that is the plurality of the values of its children.  (With only two candidates and a ternary tree, plurality is the same as majority.)\n",
    "\n",
    "The value at the root is the winner of the contest.  In this case, candidate B is the winner."

By construction, the value at any node can be confirmed by confirming the values at exactly two of its children.  Recursively this yields a binary tree that is a subtree of the ternary tabulation tree; this binary tree is shown in bold in the above figure.  We see that auditing exactly **four** of the leaves suffices to confirm that the election outcome is correct.  Note that (unlike RLAs) a TPT audit only examines ballots that are reported to be votes for the reported winner.\n"

    "a small group (typically of size 3, but sometimes 2 or 4) of votes.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This may be easy to do, such as when finding the winner among three votes, each\n",
    "of which is for one of two candidates.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other cases, when there are more than two candidates or when the size of the group is not three, a tie may ensue.  We resolve any such ties pseudorandomly, using\n",
    "a master random seed and a number unique to that particular group.  (To ensure\n",
    "neutrality, the random selection is based on picking one of the relevant votes\n",
    "randomly, rather than by trying to directly pick one of the relevant outcomes randomly.\n",
    "Perhaps a small point, but worth noting.)\n",
    "\n",
    "In any case, the small group of votes is then represented by (replaced by) its\n",
    "plurality winner.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This process of computing a plurality winner for a small group can be iterated\n",
    "to determine the TPT winner of the entire collection of votes.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We describe two such methods; they are equivalent when $n$ is a power of three.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Method 1 (Grouping by threes)**\n",
    "\n",
    "We describe the GBT method for computing a\n",
    "winner given $n$ votes, where $n>1$.  This is not our recommended\n",
    "method, but has some utility for its intuitive content, and the fact\n",
    "the GBT is the same as TPT when $n$ is a power of three.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Arrange the $n$ votes into a list.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Permute this list pseudorandomly based on a random seed.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Group the votes by threes: ballots 1,2,3 form the first group of three, ballots 4,5,6 form form the second group of three, and so on.  If the number of votes is not a multiple of three, finish the grouping with one differently-sized last group (of size 2 or 4) as necessary so that each vote is in exactly one group.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Replace each group of (usually three) ballots by the plurality winner for the ballots in that group.  \n",
    "This operation reduces the length of the list by a factor of\n",

    "A ternary tree has a number of nodes, some of which are _internal nodes_ and\n",

    "bevause it has at most one internal node with two\n",
    "children; all other internal nodes have three children.\n",
    "\n",
    "Producing the tree and computing the TPT winner then works as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Arrange the $n$ votes into a list.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Permute this list pseudorandomly based on a random seed.\n",

    "5. For each internal node $A[i]$, where $i=\\underline{ni}, \\underline{ni}-1, ..., 1$ compute the value of \n",
    "$A[i]$ as the plurality winner of the values at its children.  This is a \"bottom-up\"\n",
    "computation using the tree structure.\n",
